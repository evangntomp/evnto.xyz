Decision-making is one of the most important procedures in team management. What I mean is that a small decision could affect the rest of the project and the results. Decision-making could be the manager's responsibility or a team process. Arguments exist between supporters of both sides. On one hand, are those who support that the decision-making is upon the manager who is responsible for the project, on the other hand, are those who are convinced that decision making it's a group thing. To make matters clear, making decisions as a group is unavoidable and the best tactic to increase the team's accountability. 

Before we analyze the Abeline Paradox worth mentioned is the definition of the **Group Dynamics.**  

>Based on Wikipedia **Group dynamics** is a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group (Intragroup dynamics), or between social groups (Intergroup relations) 

## The Abeline Paradox 
**Location: Coleman, Texas**

On a hot Sunday afternoon, a family is playing dominoes on a porch. The family is suffering from the hot weather and it seems that nobody is enjoying the game until the father suggests visiting the Abeline (53 miles away). The daughter says, "Sounds good to me", then the son looking at his mother says " If you want to go, I want too". Mother fast respond " Of course I want to go to Abeline, it's been a long time". 

The ride is torture and the dinner in a cafeteria in the Abeline is awful. 

After four hours they arrive back home. The son asks " It was a great trip, wasn't?", then the daughter says that he would rather stay home but she went to keep them happy. " I went because I was agreeing with you," says the mother. The father then says that he only suggested it because they looked bored. 

The Abeline Paradox is similar to groupthink and it's not far away from reality. The members trying to be part of the team believe that their opinions are not aligned with the rest of the team and they prefer not to express themselves. 

## How to avoid 

The first step is to analyze member's behaviors and personalities. There are plenty of psychological tests and organizations that provide those types of services. Apart from psychological tests, the observation could help the team leader to see the bigger picture. Using team assessments and teamwork is a brilliant way. 

Then the daily routine.

Urge the lowest ranking members to speak first, in that way they will not get influenced by the others and after a while, they will take initiatives.  Give the space to all your members to elaborate on their opinions. 

Use brainstorming. Put into discussion the main problem an let them work on it individually then discuss as a team their suggestions. After that let them review their own suggestions. In the end make a decision as a group.

Last but not least, be honest. Let them know about the Abeline Paradox, inform them about the danger of groupthinking and how it affects the team's performance. 

***The next time before you make a decision ask yourself  "Am I going to Abeline?"***
