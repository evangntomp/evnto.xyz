I'll take you back on that day that you decided that it's time to create a powerful resume that will help you to get any job you want. First things first, you open you favourite browser and you type on searchbar "how to create a Résumé". After a little research you realize that your keywords are not enough and you decide to add some more. Maybe "tech" or "HR", what about "Teacher" ? "Student" it's better for you? And you type again "how to create a student  Résumé".  

 You worked really hard, you spent an entire Sunday and here you are, your onepage resume is in your screen and you are more than ready to start seeking for jobs opportumities. 

***The bad news; it's not enough!***

You are wondering what's worng. 

The traditional way of hiring is not what recruiters prefer nowadays.  Filling a database with, picking some of them to proced on interviews and then hire the most suitable person is more or less an old strategy.
