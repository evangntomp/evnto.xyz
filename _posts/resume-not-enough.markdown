## Your resume is not enough

I'll take you back on that day that you decided that it's time to create a powerful resume that will help you to get any job you want. First things first, you open your favorite browser and you type on search bar "how to create a resume".  After a little research, you realize that your keywords are not enough and you decide to add some extra keywords. Maybe "tech" or "HR", what about "Teacher"? "Student" it's better for you? And you type again "how to create a student resume".  

 You worked really hard, you spent an entire Sunday and here you are, your one-page resume is on your screen and you are more than ready to start seeking job opportunities. 

***The bad news; that's not enough!***

You are wondering what's wrong? 

The traditional way of hiring is not what recruiters prefer nowadays.  Filling a database with applications and picking some of them to proceed on interviews and then hire the most suitable person is more or less an old strategy.  

***Golden Rule: make them feel secure by choosing you***
 
There are two are two ultimate questions that you should answer before you start applying:

 1. **Who you are?**
 2. **Who do you know?**



### Who you are?


- Create online profiles on platforms related to your job. What I mean is that you don't have just to sign up but you have also to be active. **Being active means that they notice you!** 

-  **demonstrate your work!** Post pictures on your social media and create your personal web page and upload your work there!  It doesn't matter if it's perfect if you hide it you will never know!

-  **Don't forget your hobbies!** If you are a runner post your goals and your high scores if you are a reader post your book reviews. Your hobbies are part of your personality and your personality it's important, talk about you not only about your skills. 

### Who do you know? 

 - Before "your application is successfully submitted" do your research for the company. Do not forget to find out who's working there, if someone who you know is working for the company, kindly informs him that soon you will apply for the company and **ask for useful tips!** 
 
 - **Ask for feedback!** Use your network to develop yourself! In that way, you will demonstrate your work and you will 

 - **Make it loud!** Inform your network that you are available! Tell your friends, your family, your followers that you looking for your next job. 


I'm sure that you are passionate about your job and you have worked hard.   ***So, let them know!***
