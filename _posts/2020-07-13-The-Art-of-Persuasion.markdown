# The Art of Persuasion

If you think carefully you will surely remember a time that you needed to persuate someone. The sience of persuasion makes the people say yes to our requests in totaly ethcal way.  

Let's run through 6 scientifically validated principales of persuasion that demands small. practical and costless changes.

### Reciprocity

People are used to giveback when they recieve. For instance, in a restaurant when the waiter brings in your table a gift, let's say a candy, the posibility to give him extra tips increases by 3%, if he brings you 2 candies the posibility extremely increases by 14%. When he brings you a special candy making a comment like " this extra candy it's only for you" the possibilty of extra tips reaches the 23%!  


###Scarcity 

People want of those things are less. Take a moment and thing when you was the last time that you bought something just because you noticed the sign "Last Pieces! Hurry Up!" When we feel that is our last change and unable to predict if it will another one we use to make fast desicions. For example, during the CoViD-19 the lack of toilet paper was caused by the fear of the lack of toilet paper. 

### Authority

The credible knowledgeable experts will be followed. The power of uniform makes us feel safe, between two strangers we are more likely to trust the one who is wearing a uniform. Authority is not only uniforms. Let's take a look in Customer Support department of a company. A client who is trying to solve a problem or wnat to buy a new product is more likely to get satisfaied if the  representative says "Let me connect you with the X emploee who is expert in this specific topic" rather than "Let me connext you with the X department of the company"


### Consistency 

People like to be consistent with the thing have previously said or done. Consistency is activated by looking for, and asking for commitments that can be made. 


### Liking

People prefer to say yes to those that they like. We tend to like peoople who are similar to us, pay us cimpliments and those who cooperate with us to achieve a common goal.  Imagine ithat you are challenged to make pairs in order to deliver a project. If you randomly pick someone you have 55% chance to come on a succesfuly aggreement. But, if you discuss about your interests and you find thing in common you 90% to come on a succesfuly aggreement. 

### Consensus
People will  look at the actions of other to determine their own. A potential customer is more likely to buy our product if he finds out that similiar companies are already customers. For instance, a potential client form an IT company will feel more secure if in our company's presentation mention that 35% of our clients are IT companies. 


Those 6 princeples can lead big defferences in you ability to influence others when you need to persuate somebody.
